RNV-GOLD-ALIGNMENT-TOOL-DO-NOT-SWEEP

Read the palette for gold TEXT instead of hard-coding a brand constant, in the
two places rnv-icon-builder still does.

    python up.py             # apply, then verify
    python up.py --check     # rehearse every edit in memory, write nothing
    python up.py --verify    # run the suites only, change nothing
    python up.py --finish    # delete this file

TWO SITES. ONE MOVES A PIXEL IN LIGHT; THE OTHER MOVES ONE ONLY IF SOMETHING
ELSE IS FIXED FIRST.

1. RNV_Icon_Builder.py, the thumbnail label hover. The light branch writes
   BRAND_DARK_GOLD #8c7337 on the thumbnail frame, which is painted
   LIGHT_THEME_COLORS['panel_bg'] #f5f5f5:

       #8c7337 on #f5f5f5   4.1670   fails the 4.5 text floor
       #7e6529 on #f5f5f5   5.0949   clears

   The palette already names the answer: text_accent is #7e6529 in light and
   #d2bc93 in dark. Both branches now read it, so the dark branch is a no-op
   and the bypass is gone from both.

2. ui/metadata_panel.py, the panel title. It writes BRAND_GOLD #d2bc93 with no
   mode check at all, so in light it would be #d2bc93 on panel_bg #f5f5f5 --
   1.6964:1, effectively unreadable. It reads c['text_accent'] now, from the
   palette the method already resolved.

   WHETHER THAT IS LIVE TODAY IS UNSETTLED. MetadataPanel is constructed
   nowhere in this repository outside tests; _apply_theme() defaults to
   is_dark=True, and the public apply_theme(is_dark) is only ever called from
   tests/test_ui_interactions.py. So the light path may be reachable only from
   the suite. The fix is the same either way and costs nothing in dark, where
   text_accent IS BRAND_GOLD.

THE REVIEW TABLE HAD A FALSE REASON IN IT, AND THAT IS THE PART WORTH READING

tests/test_brand_contrast.py keeps REVIEWED: a table of deliberate palette
bypasses, keyed by declaration text, each with a sentence saying why it is
correct. Three entries carried the same sentence -- "correct: mode-guarded by
the caller" -- and it was true of none of them:

  - metadata_panel has NO caller. Nothing outside the tests constructs it.
  - the two preview_utils sites ARE correct, but for a different reason: they
    are hover borders drawn over an arbitrary user colour swatch, so the ground
    is the swatch and not a themed surface. That is exactly what the
    settings_dialog entry says, correctly, three lines below. The right answer
    with the wrong justification, copied twice.

An exemption is only as good as its reason, and nothing in a test suite checks
prose. The two surviving entries are rewritten with the reason that is true.

AND THE GUARD THAT PROVED THE SCAN WAS WORKING WAS A BARE COUNT

test_the_bypass_scan_is_still_looking asserted the scan found at least five
sites. Fixing three of the seven takes it to four, and a guard-the-guard that
fails because the thing it guards got BETTER is not measuring what it thinks.
It is anchored now on the three bypasses that can never be fixed -- the swatch
borders -- rather than on how many there happen to be.

WHAT THIS SCRIPT ADDS

tests/test_gold_as_text.py sweeps every f-string in the app, pulls `color:` and
`background-color:` out of each QSS rule, resolves the placeholders through
this app's own palettes, and fails any gold-family foreground under 4.5:1 on
the ground it is drawn on. Its blind spots are assertions rather than prose: if
the number of pairs it resolves collapses, it fails instead of passing quietly.

GUARD_SOURCE = '"""Gold drawn as TEXT must clear the text floor on the ground it is drawn on.\n\nWHY THIS EXISTS. The gold family has two members that look interchangeable and\nare not. BRAND_DARK_GOLD #8c7337 fills and bounds correctly on light surfaces\nand FAILS as text on them; BRAND_DARK_GOLD_DEEP #7e6529 is the derivative that\nexists for text, and the palettes name it `accent_ink` -- "Accent when it\ncarries text". In DARK MODE THE TWO ARE THE SAME VALUE, so every check written\nwhere they coincide is blind to the case where they diverge, and that is\nexactly what happened: gold-as-text sites shipped in light mode at 3.71 and\n4.17 against a 4.5 floor, in more than one application, for as long as the\ndialogs have existed.\n\nWHAT IT DOES. Reads every f-string in the source, pulls `color:` and\n`background-color:` out of each QSS rule, resolves the placeholders through\nthis app\'s own palettes, and measures. A declaration whose foreground is a\ngold-family value and whose contrast falls below the floor fails.\n\nWHAT IT CANNOT SEE, stated because a sweep that reports only what it found\nlooks identical to one that found nothing:\n\n  - a placeholder that is not a palette lookup, a module constant or a local\n    bound to one is UNRESOLVED and skipped\n  - a rule with no background-color of its own INHERITS, and the ground is\n    taken from the palette\'s window or panel value, which is a guess\n\nBoth counts are asserted rather than printed: if the resolved count collapses,\nthe sweep has gone blind and says so instead of passing.\n\nREADING THE MODE. A block written inside `if self._is_dark:` and bound with\n`_d = ThemeManager.DARK_THEME` is dark-only, and scoring it against the light\npalette invents a pairing that never renders.
