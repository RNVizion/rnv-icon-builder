RNV-WIRING-TOOL-DO-NOT-SWEEP

Give every hex in rnv-icon-builder's palettes a constant, and collapse the strays.

    python up.py             # apply, then verify

WHY

56 palette entries in this repository were written as bare hex literals
-- 49 of them in the light palette. A literal cannot follow a register
change: when rnv-brand moves a value, every constant that mirrors it moves and
every literal stays behind. That is how #c4a458 was orphaned, and it is why
this programme's standing rule is that every hex a palette carries has a
constant between the value and its use.

The dark palette was already wired, almost entirely. Light was not, because
light was built later and by hand. So this is mostly a light pass -- but the
rule is per palette, and the handful of dark literals go with it.


WHAT IS WIRED, AND HOW THE NAMES WERE CHOSEN

Registered values take the register's name, as APP_CARD / APP_BORDER /
APP_HOVER_LIGHT already do here. Ramp greys take the ramp name, by byte, as
rnv-text-transformer does: GREY_CC, GREY_66. Nothing here is a new colour;
every constant this script adds is a hex the palettes already carried.

THE SPLIT. rnv-text-transformer ruled, in tests/test_ladder_and_plate.py, that
a hex whose register role is an INTERACTION STATE takes the register's name
only on keys that play that role -- "GREY_EE IS SPLIT, NOT RENAMED ... a
resting ground is not an interaction state, and wiring all four would claim a
role for three of them on the strength of a shared hex." The same shape is
applied here:

    #e0e0e0  pressed_bg          -> APP_PRESSED_LIGHT   plays the role
    #e0e0e0  tab_bg, scrollbar_bg -> GREY_E0            static, shares the hex
    #eeeeee  a hover             -> APP_HOVER_LIGHT
    #eeeeee  a list header       -> GREY_EE
    #dddddd  text                -> APP_TEXT
    #dddddd  a grid line         -> GREY_DD

Surfaces (#f5f5f5, #fbfbfb) and the border (#333333) are not split, because
every key that carries them plays the role.


THREE STRAYS COLLAPSE, AND THIS MOVES PIXELS

Three light greys sat on no ladder -- named nowhere, in any of the five
applications -- and each was a fraction of a step from a registered rung:

    #fafafa  ->  #fbfbfb  APP surface-light-2   CIEDE2000 0.20
    #f8f8f8  ->  #fbfbfb  APP surface-light-2   CIEDE2000 0.60
    #f0f0f0  ->  #eeeeee  APP hover-light       CIEDE2000 0.42

Ruled by Chris on 2026-09-06 onto the nearest rung, on the same reasoning as
#252525 onto the card and #505050 onto grey 44: a value under one CIEDE2000
from a registered one is that one, misspelled. Below any threshold this
register has ever called a visible step. Everything else in this script is a
rename with no pixel moved.

In this repository: platform_btn_bg (#fafafa), list_alt_bg (#f8f8f8),
list_header_bg and platform_btn_hover_bg (#f0f0f0). All four are live.
The button hover takes APP_HOVER_LIGHT because it IS a hover; the
header takes GREY_EE because it is not.

OS_SIM_COLORS also holds #f0f0f0, as 'taskbar_light_bg'. It is NOT
collapsed and must not be: that dict simulates real OS chrome and its
values are the platform's, not the brand's -- the same class as
SVG_EXPORT_BG. The guard sweeps the three theme palettes only.

WHAT THE GUARD PINS

It reads the three palette dicts back through `ast` and fails on any value
that is a string hex, so a literal cannot come back. It asserts the split --
that `pressed_bg` resolves to the register's pressed plate and the static keys
do not -- and it asserts the collapsed keys resolve to their rung. And it
checks that no two constants in this module hold the same hex UNLESS they are
a declared split pair, so a second name for one colour cannot appear without
saying which role it plays.
