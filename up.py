RNV-WIRING-TOOL-DO-NOT-SWEEP

rnv-icon-builder: stop calling Image.getdata(), which Pillow removes on 2027-10-15.

    python up.py             # apply, then verify
    python up.py --check     # rehearse, write nothing
    python up.py --verify    # re-run the suites against what is on disk
    python up.py --finish    # delete this script

THE DEADLINE IS REAL AND DATED. Pillow 12.1 deprecated `Image.getdata()` and
Pillow 14 removes it, on 2027-10-15, naming `get_flattened_data()` as the
replacement. On that day these call sites stop working -- and in three colour
applications, sampling colour out of an image is not a side feature.

THE OBVIOUS FIX IS WRONG. Swapping the call breaks the application today,
because `get_flattened_data` does not exist before Pillow 12.1 and this
project supports Pillow 10. Measured across six releases in a clean
virtualenv rather than assumed:

    Pillow 10.4.0   get_flattened_data absent    getdata not deprecated
    Pillow 11.0.0   absent                       not deprecated
    Pillow 11.3.0   absent                       not deprecated
    Pillow 12.0.0   absent                       not deprecated
    Pillow 12.1.0   PRESENT                      DEPRECATED
    Pillow 12.2.0   present                      deprecated

So the call has to ask the object which API it has. This installs
utils/pil_compat.py, which asks once, and routes 2 call site(s) through it.

The two APIs are behaviourally identical -- same length, same tuples, same
palette indices -- verified on RGB, RGBA, L and P.

WHAT DOES NOT CHANGE. No colour, no pixel, no palette. `flat_pixels(x)`
returns precisely what `list(x.getdata())` returned.

A NOTE ON THE PINS, WHICH THIS SCRIPT DOES NOT TOUCH. This repository declares
Pillow in two files and they disagree. That is worth a decision of its own and
is reported separately; nothing here changes a dependency.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. `Image.getdata()` was deprecated in Pillow 12.1 and will
be REMOVED in Pillow 14, dated 2027-10-15. The deprecation names
`get_flattened_data()` as its replacement.

The obvious fix -- swap the call -- breaks this application today, because
`get_flattened_data` does not exist before Pillow 12.1 and this project
supports Pillow 10. Measured rather than assumed:

    Pillow 10.4.0   get_flattened_data absent    getdata not deprecated

    Pillow 12.2.0   present                      deprecated

So the call has to ask which Pillow it is running on. Asking once, here, is
better than asking at each call site: there were five of them across three
applications, and the next person to add a sixth will not know to ask.

The two are behaviourally identical -- same length, same tuples, same palette
indices -- verified on RGB, RGBA, L and P in tests/test_pil_compat.py.

utils.pil_compat.flat_pixels, which picks the available API at runtime.

WHAT MAKES THIS GUARD HARD TO WRITE HONESTLY. Whichever Pillow the suite runs
on, only ONE branch of the helper executes. A test that exercises the
installed branch and reports green says nothing about the other one -- and the
other one is the one that matters, because it is either the future (removal)
or the past (every version this project still supports). So both branches are
driven explicitly, with stand-in objects, rather than being left to whichever
Pillow happens to be installed.
