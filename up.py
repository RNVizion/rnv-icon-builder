RNV-GOLD-ALIGNMENT-TOOL-DO-NOT-SWEEP

Name the APP register in rnv-icon-builder, and move the dark ink onto the grid.

WHAT MOVES

  DARK  text_primary, button_text, main_btn_text, main_btn_hover_text,
        tooltip_text      #e0e0e0 -> APP_TEXT (#dddddd)

  IMAGE inherits, because IMAGE_MODE_COLORS spreads DARK_THEME_COLORS.

  LIGHT pressed_bg, tab_bg, scrollbar_bg      UNCHANGED at #e0e0e0.

WHY THE VALUE MOVED, AND WHY ONLY HALF OF IT

#e0e0e0 was one hex doing two unrelated jobs: ink in dark mode, and a light
surface in the light palette. It sat off the published ink grid at n = 13.18
and refused to be pulled onto it -- because the grid governs inks and half its
uses were not ink. Split the roles and both halves land: the ink moves to
grey(13) #dddddd, the surface stays where it is. rnv-brand@68d195e publishes
both the move and the rule, including the sentence that the grid does not
govern surfaces and never can.

WHY THE NAMING HAD TO COME FIRST

This app held #e0e0e0 -- and #1a1a1a, #2a2a2a, #333333 -- as bare literals
with no constant and no provenance. The brand could have moved and nothing
here would have noticed. Naming them without moving anything would have been
half a job; moving them without naming them would have left nothing holding
the new value. So the same pass does both, and the guard asserts the ink is
spelled as a NAME rather than a value.

TWO GUARDS, NOT ONE

rnv-text-transformer's mirror test guards with importorskip('engine.brand'),
so where rnv-brand is not importable it reports clean and drift hides. Every
register value is therefore pinned locally as well as mirrored upstream. The
pin catches drift when the brand is absent; the mirror catches the brand
moving. Neither alone is enough, and this one nearly proved it.

THE OTHER FIVE CONSTANTS ARE DEFINED BUT NOT YET WIRED. That is deliberate and
said out loud in ui/colors.py: rewiring them is a mechanical substitution and
this pass is a value change. Mixing the two would make the diff unreadable and
the snapshot evidence worthless.
