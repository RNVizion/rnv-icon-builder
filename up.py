RNV-GOLD-ALIGNMENT-TOOL-DO-NOT-SWEEP

Wire rnv-icon-builder's dark palettes to the register it already mirrors.

    python up.py             # apply, then verify
    python up.py --check     # rehearse every edit in memory, write nothing
    python up.py --verify    # run the suites only, change nothing
    python up.py --finish    # delete this file

WHAT MOVES: NOTHING. Not one rendered pixel.

This changes how every registered values in DARK and IMAGE are SPELLED, not what they
are. Every one becomes the name of a constant this app already defines and
already mirrors against RNVizion/rnv-brand:

    '#000000' -> TRUE_BLACK        '#2a2a2a' -> APP_CARD
    '#1a1a1a' -> BRAND_BLACK       '#333333' -> APP_BORDER

The script proves it moved nothing rather than asserting it: checks() resolves
every entry of every palette from the ORIGINAL file and from the EDITED one,
and refuses to write unless all three palettes are equal entry for entry.

WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE PASS

The ink pass defined and mirrored these four constants but left the palettes
spelling them out. That was deliberate and said out loud at the time: a
mechanical substitution mixed into a value change makes the diff unreadable and
the snapshot evidence worthless. This is the substitution, alone.

WHY THE DARK HALF ONLY

rnv-brand@8ab1174 rules the order. The dark surface ladder is two-thirds
specified and entirely inside the register; the light ladder is not ruled at
all. Nine light surfaces sit between grid n = 12.24 and n = 15.00 -- inside
three steps of a grid that steps 0x11 -- and which of them are real
distinctions is a judgement the register has not made yet. Wiring light now
would mean wiring it twice.

The guard asserts the light palettes were left alone, so that when the light
half is ruled, one test has to be deleted on purpose rather than a scope
quietly widening.

THE POINT OF THE WHOLE THING

A literal cannot follow its base. APP["text"] moved on 2026-08-28 and two of
these five apps would have kept the old value silently, because it was written
down rather than referenced. After this pass there is no registered value left
written down in a dark palette, and the guard is what keeps it that way.
