Collapse #252525 onto APP_CARD in icon-builder's dark palette.

    python up.py             # apply, then verify
    python up.py --check     # rehearse every edit in memory, write nothing
    python up.py --verify    # run the suites only, change nothing

WHY

The colour tree (2026-09-02) found five values named nowhere in the fleet. Rev
27 retires two of them into the light ladder and a third turned out to be
STATUS["error-text"] already. The last two were rendered beside their
neighbours and ruled on by Chris:

    #252525  ->  collapse onto APP card #2a2a2a
    #505050  ->  collapse onto grey 44   #444444

#252525 sat a third of the way from panel #1a1a1a to card #2a2a2a -- 1.1354
above one, 1.0679 below the other, neither a visible step. #505050 was one
application's private scrollbar handle where the other four already use
#444444. Neither was on the ladder or the ink grid. After this, neither exists.

THIS MOVES PIXELS. It is a ruling being applied, not a rename, and the guard
pins both the new values and the constants they are wired through.

WHAT MOVES HERE

    #252525  ->  #2a2a2a  (APP_CARD)   {'dark': ['platform_btn_bg', 'scrollbar_bg', 'list_alt_bg'], 'image': ['platform_btn_bg', 'list_alt_bg']}

The guard reads the palettes by importing them and pins the new values, then
reads the source and asserts each key is wired through APP_CARD rather than
written as a fresh literal -- a script that swapped one literal for another
would pass the first check and fail the second.
