"""RNV-LIGHT-WIRING-GUARD -- every palette value has a name, and the split holds.

Installed 2026-09-06. Three things it pins:

  * no value in any palette is a bare hex -- a literal cannot follow the
    register, so one appearing here is a value that will be orphaned;
  * the SPLIT: the register's interaction-state names sit only on keys that
    play the role, and static keys sharing the hex keep the ramp name;
  * the three collapsed strays resolve to their rung, and the old values are
    gone from the module.
