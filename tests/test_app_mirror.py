"""
The APP register, mirrored -- and the ink move that made mirroring necessary.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Until 2026-08-28 this app carried #e0e0e0, #1a1a1a,
#2a2a2a and #333333 as bare hex literals with no constant and no provenance.
Every one of them is a REGISTERED value in RNVizion/rnv-brand. A registered
value could have moved upstream and this app would have kept the old one
silently -- the same failure #c4a458 had, one level down.

It nearly happened. `APP["text"]` moved from #e0e0e0 to #dddddd in
rnv-brand@68d195e, and nothing here would have noticed.

THE INK GRID, published in the brand beside that move:

    grey(n) = n * 0x11, n in 0..15.   TRUE_BLACK -> WHITE in fifteen steps.

It governs INKS AND EDGES and deliberately does not govern surfaces --
BRAND_BLACK sits at n = 1.53 and APP_CARD at n = 2.47, and BRAND_BLACK is a
permanent that will not move to fit a ladder.

TWO GUARDS, NOT ONE. rnv-text-transformer's mirror test guards with
`pytest.importorskip('engine.brand')`, so where rnv-brand is not importable it
reports clean and drift hides. Every register value here is therefore pinned
LOCALLY as well as mirrored UPSTREAM: the pin catches drift when the brand is
absent, the mirror catches the brand moving. Neither alone is enough.
