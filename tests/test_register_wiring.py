"""
The dark half of the derivation: every registered value spelled as a NAME.

WHAT THIS PASS DID. The ink pass of 2026-08-28 defined and mirrored the APP
register here but deliberately left the palettes spelling those values as
literals -- rewiring is a mechanical substitution and that pass was a value
change, and mixing the two makes the diff unreadable and the snapshot evidence
worthless. This is the substitution, on its own, in DARK and IMAGE only.

WHY DARK ONLY. rnv-brand@8ab1174 rules the order: the dark surface ladder is
two-thirds specified and entirely inside the register, while the light ladder
is not ruled at all -- nine light surfaces sit inside three grid steps and the
register has not yet decided which of them are real distinctions. Deriving
against that gap would mean deriving twice.

NOTHING MOVED. This pass changes how values are spelled, not what they are.
The delivery script proved it by resolving both palettes before and after and
comparing them entry by entry; these tests hold the result in place.

THE POINT OF IT. A literal cannot follow its base. APP["text"] moved on
2026-08-28 and this app would have kept the old value silently, because the
value was written down rather than referenced. Every registered value in the
dark palettes is now a name, so the next register move carries.
