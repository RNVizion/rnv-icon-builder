"""#252525 no longer exists in this application. RNV-COLLAPSE-GUARD

Ruled 2026-09-02: #252525 collapses onto APP_CARD #2a2a2a. The value was on
neither the surface ladder nor the ink grid, and its neighbours were not a
visible step away. This guard pins the ruling in both directions: the keys
hold the new value, and they hold it THROUGH the constant.
